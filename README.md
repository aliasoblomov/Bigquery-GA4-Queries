Welcome to the **BigQuery-GA4-Queries** repository! This open-source collection is a curated set of SQL queries specifically designed for analyzing and extracting insights from **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** exported data in BigQuery. Over years of working with GA4 data exports, these queries have become my go-to tools for daily reporting and analysis, and I am excited to share them.

## Whatâ€™s Included?

This repository contains a +50 diverse set of **ready-to-use and fully customizable queries**, grouped into logical folders for easier access and organization. Each query is designed to handle common and advanced use cases, from session analysis and ecommerce reporting to traffic attribution and user behavior exploration.

## How to Use

1. Replace placeholder project IDs and dataset names in each query with your specific BigQuery identifiers.
2. Adjust the `DECLARE` statements at the beginning of each query to define your desired reporting dates.
3. Run the queries in BigQuery to instantly generate reports tailored to your needs.
